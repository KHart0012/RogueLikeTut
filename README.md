# RogueLikeTut

## Current Ideas

I would like to make a rogue-like over a game I started making years ago.

- It would need to have at least 4 main classes that have different abilities or unique things with them.

- Some class ideas like, Cyber-Soldier, Lightning Rogue, Technomancer, Mutant Beserker

- I would like to have it be scifi themed with it being more post apocolyptic. Kind of like CoQ

- I like the open world of CoQ but I would like to travel between planets. The goal is to collect all the universe crystals and make it back to earth.

- I think that ship battles could be cool and upgrading your ship to deal with things could be cool. I don't know how I will do outer space yet, but that is something I could figure out.

- Each class will have their own unique system that they upgrade as they level up.

- Cyber-Soldier could have a cybernetic upgrade system from random cybernetics

- Lightning Rogue could have something?

- Technomancer could have a robot upgrade path, in which they never actually buff their character, only their robots get buffed.

- Mutant Berserker can get more and more mutations at random that could help them.

- I like the God system in DCSS but I think that there could be mroe interesting things done with it.

- There will have to be some kind of currency that all planets use, and there should be non-hostile zones.

- I would like in the end there be 2 ways to play, with Terrans(Good) or with Scoltons(Bad).

- I would prefer that the game only takes about 3 to 5 hours to complete a playthrough, shorter playthroughs will last about 1 to 2 hours and they will require less crystals.

- Whenever you get one of these crystals, I would like you to also get a buff based on which universe crystal it is.

- I know it sounds like the infinity stones, and thats probably because they are.
